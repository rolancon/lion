# Lion
The Lion programming language

Based on combining MAL (Make A Lisp), which is a tiny Lisp dialect inspired by Clojure, with JSON (reminiscent of Amazon's Ion which, amongst other extensions, adds s-expressions to JSON).

The MAL code (written in Nim) is derived from the MAL repository, which is under the Mozilla Public license 2.0. The JSON code is derived from the Nim JSON parser, which is under the MIT license.
